| [JointRank: Rank Large Set with Single Pass](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22262v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/V3RGANz/jointrank) | Efficiently ranking relevant items from large candidate pools is a cornerstone of modern information retrieval systems -- such as web search, recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Listwise rerankers, which improve relevance by jointly considering multiple candidates, are often limited in practice: either by model input size constraints, or by degraded quality when processing large sets. We propose a model-agnostic method for fast reranking large sets that exceed a model input limits. The method first partitions candidate items into overlapping blocks, each of which is ranked independently in parallel. Implicit pairwise comparisons are then derived from these local rankings. Finally, these comparisons are aggregated to construct a global ranking using algorithms such as Winrate or PageRank. Experiments on TREC DL-2019 show that our method achieves an nDCG@10 of 70.88 compared to the 57.68 for full-context listwise approach using gpt-4.1-mini as long-context model, while reducing latency from 21 to 8 seconds. The implementation of the algorithm and the experiments is available in the repository: https://github.com/V3RGANz/jointrank |  |
| [Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21185v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/7uheng/occood) | 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/7uHeng/OccOoD. |  |
| [Beyond Reactive Safety: Risk-Aware LLM Alignment via Long-Horizon Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20949v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/chenkaisun/proactivealignment) | Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse, non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks (AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer agents. |  |
| [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21215v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/haoang97/causalprobe-2024) | Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis, methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal. Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024, whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2. |  |
| [RecCoT: Enhancing Recommendation via Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21032v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/shuoyang2/reccot) | In real-world applications, users always interact with items in multiple aspects, such as through implicit binary feedback (e.g., clicks, dislikes, long views) and explicit feedback (e.g., comments, reviews). Modern recommendation systems (RecSys) learn user-item collaborative signals from these implicit feedback signals as a large-scale binary data-streaming, subsequently recommending other highly similar items based on users' personalized historical interactions. However, from this collaborative-connection perspective, the RecSys does not focus on the actual content of the items themselves but instead prioritizes higher-probability signals of behavioral co-occurrence among items. Consequently, under this binary learning paradigm, the RecSys struggles to understand why a user likes or dislikes certain items. To alleviate it, some works attempt to utilize the content-based reviews to capture the semantic knowledge to enhance recommender models. However, most of these methods focus on predicting the ratings of reviews, but do not provide a human-understandable explanation. |  |
| [ReME: A Data-Centric Framework for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21233v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/xiweix/reme) | Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

| [Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching in Document Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21055v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pd162/roi-matching) | Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions, such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient, multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/RoI-Matching. |  |
| [Parallels Between VLA Model Post-Training and Human Motor Learning: Progress, Challenges, and Trends](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20966v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/aoqunjin/awesome-vla-post-training) | Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1) enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3) deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

| [Transformer-Based Spatial-Temporal Counterfactual Outcomes Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21154v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lihe-maxsize/deppstci_release_version-master) | The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore, estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

| [OracleFusion: Assisting the Decipherment of Oracle Bone Script with Structurally Constrained Semantic Typography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21101v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lcs0215/oraclefusion) | As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters, only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF), incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for advancing the decipherment of OBS. |  |
| [Discovering multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes using diverse top-k subgroup list discovery](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/discovering-multiple-antibiotic-resistance) | [GitHub](https://github.com/antoniolopezmc/Discovering-multiple-antibiotic-resistance-phenotypes-using-diverse-top-k-subgroup-list-discovery) | Antibiotic resistance is one of the major global threats to human health and occurs when antibiotics lose their ability to combat bacterial infections. In this problem, a clinical decision support system could use phenotypes in order to alert clinicians of the emergence of patterns of antibiotic resistance in patients. Patient phenotyping is the task of finding a set of patient characteristics related to a specific medical problem such as the one described in this work. However, a single explanation of a medical phenomenon might be useless in the eyes of a clinical expert and be discarded. The discovery of multiple patient phenotypes for the same medical phenomenon would be useful in such cases. Therefore, in this work, we define the problem of mining diverse top-k phenotypes and propose the EDSLM algorithm, which is based on the Subgroup Discovery technique, the subgroup list model, and the Minimum Description Length principle. Our proposal provides clinicians with a method with which to obtain multiple and diverse phenotypes of a set of patients. We show a real use case of phenotyping in antimicrobial resistance using the well-known MIMIC-III dataset. |  |
| [Robust Deep Learning for Myocardial Scar Segmentation in Cardiac MRI with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21151v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/danialmoa/yolosam) | The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging. |  |
| [EraRAG: Efficient and Incremental Retrieval Augmented Generation for Growing Corpora](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20963v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/everm0re/erarag-official) | Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus. However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and adaptability. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/EverM0re/EraRAG-Official. |  |
